Teensy files were tested using a Teensy 3.2, the Arduino IDE + Teensyduino, and the Arduino IDE set according to the notes below. 
Eventually, all Teensy code will (hopefully) be merged into one master program.

NES/SNES:
- CPU Speed: 96MHz (default)
- Optimize: Faster

Genesis (3 button controller):
- CPU Speed: 120MHz (overclock)
- Optimize: Fastest
