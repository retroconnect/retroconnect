## **Project Summary**

* **The problem:**

    Retro game collectors worldwide often stumble across an issue with their collections: controllers. They take up a lot of space, the cords tangle up, and they often break down and need replacements which are usually pricey.

* **Our solution:**

    Our solution is a Bluetooth dongle which can wirelessly connect to a modern bluetooth controller of the user's choosing.The dongle can then be plugged in using a unique connector for each game console to adapt the Bluetooth dongleâ€™s inputs to correct controller outputs for the target console. Suddenly, the great pile of old controllers is reduced to a single favorite controller.
    
    

## **Project Goals**

#### Completed Features:
- Supported input devices: 
  - Xbox One (XB1)
  - PlayStation 4 (PS4)
- Supported output devices:
  - Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)
  - Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES)
- Analog sticks map to D-pads
- Button combos to change output console
- Less than 1 frame of input lag
- Electronic safety with proper voltage handling

#### Future Features:

- Single MCU instead of Raspberry Pi and Teensy
- Manufactured console adapters with standard USB-C plug
- 3D printed case
- Support for input devices: Switch Joycons, DualShock 3 / SixAxis, Wii, third party controllers
- Support for output devices: Genesis, Saturn, Dreamcast, Nintendo 64, PlayStation 1, Atari 2600, and more
- A web app UI for customizing the controller mappings

## **Usage**

#### Requirements
- Teensy 3.2 (or other compatible microcontroller)
- Raspberry Pi Zero W (or similar)
- Console-specific adapters that connect to Teensy pin headers
- Wires to connect the Teensy to the Raspberry Pi

#### Teensy Setup
Open the `NES_SNES.ino` file using the Arduino IDE, and upload it to your microcontroller.  

#### Raspberry Pi Setup
1. Pull the git repo, compile with `make`.
2. Modify configs found in the `configs/` folder to suit your preferences
3. Run `sudo retroconnect`. Sudo is necessary on the very first run to disable Bluetooth's Enhanced Retransmission Mode (ERTM) which breaks certain functionality of the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 controllers.

#### Wiring
1. Teensy 3.2 wiring is as follows:
  - SNES:
    - GND
    - RX0 0
    - TX0 1
    - DATA 2
    - CLOCK 3
    - LATCH 4
    - 5V line is unused

  - NES:
    - GND
    - RX0 0
    - TX0 1
    - DATA 2
    - CLOCK 3
    - LATCH 4 
    - 5V line is unused
    
2. Wire the RX0 line from the Teensy to the TX line of the Raspberry Pi. Wire the TX0 line from the Teensy to the RX line of the Raspberry Pi. 

#### Execution
Execute the `retroconnect` program. If a compatible Bluetooth controller is not detected, it will automatically scan for supported devices in sync mode. Once a suitable controller is connected, it will display your button inputs in the terminal and button inputs will be converted and forwarded to the target console.

#### Button Combos
- HOME + South Button = SNES mode (default)
- HOME + East Button = NES mode 
- HOME + West Button = Genesis mode

## **File Organization**

The following outlines the basic structure of our ```root``` folder and git repository
```
root/
    src/
      Bluetooth/
      Mapping/
        ControllerModels/
          Controller.cpp
          XboxController.cpp
          SnesController.cpp
          ...
        ControllerConverters/
          ControllerConverter.cpp
          ControllerConverterFactory.cpp
          XboxToSnesControllerConverter.cpp
          ...
      Backend/
        Backend.cpp
        SNESBackend.cpp
        ...
    build/
    configs/
    NES_SNES.ino
    Readme.md
    LICENSE
    .gitignore
```

### **```root/```**
The ```root/``` directory contains the following components:
- ```src/``` is meant to hold all our source code
- ```build/``` is meant to hold the compiled and built code ready to run retroconnect
- ```configs/``` is meant to hold user-configurable mapping config files
- ```configs/``` is the Arduino code to be flashed to a Teensy 3.2 or other MCU
- ```Readme.md``` is the file you are reading
- ```LICENSE``` is a text file describing our code's legal licensing

### **```src/```**
The ```src/``` directory is divided into the logical components that makeup the dataflow of our program
- ```Mapping/``` handles converting one controllers state to another's
    - ```ControllerModels/``` holds all the classes that define a controller's inputs and states, as well as the abstract Controller class that they all inherit from
    - ```ControllerConverters/``` holds all the classes that  have methods for converting one controller model to another, as well as the interface all controller converters will implement.
- ```Backend/``` holds all the classes that have methods for writing a controllers state to its corresponding console, as well as the interface all backends will implement.
