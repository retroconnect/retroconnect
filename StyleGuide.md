# RetroConnect Team Style Guide

---

## Areas of Focus:
---
* **External Documentation**
* **Class Documentation**
* **Interal Documentation & Naming**
* **Indentation**
* **Miscellaneous**
---
#### External Documentation:
* At the top of each file created, the name of the team member working on this file and a brief description of the purpose of the file should be added.
#### Class Documentation:
* Each support class is to be preceded with a block comment that includes:
   * Class name
   * Names of external packages the class depends on
   * Parameter names and brief description
   * Brief note on the classes purpose

#### Internal Documentation & Naming:
* It is encouraged to name variables and methods descriptively, but if variable names become scarce inline comments are necesary for future readability.
* *Complex* pieces of code are encouraged to be commented heavily.


#### Indentation:

* RetroConnect is a **Tab** operated team with **tab stop = 4**. The use of spaces by a RetroConnect employee will result in immediate termination.


#### Miscellaneous:
* The following guidelanes are reccomended to follow when writing any code:
  * Write programs with modularity; that is, create classes when appropriate, write methods that accomplish limited and well-defined tasks
  * **Limited** or very monitored use of Global Variables
  * Indent bodies of methods, loops and IF statements with consistent style
  * Polish code before merging to Master branch
