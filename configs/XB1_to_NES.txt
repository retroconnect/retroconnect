* Tips:
*   - Format is XBOX=NES. For example, if you wanted the X button on the Xbox controller to trigger the B button on the NES, write X=B.
*   - Use NULL keyword if you don't want the button to map to anything. B=NULL means pressing B on the Xbox controller has no effect.
*   - You can assign an output button to multiple input buttons. For example, X=B and Y=B. 
*   - When creating a new config file, keep the separator marker below.
