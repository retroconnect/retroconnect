* Tips:
*   - Format is XBOX=2600. For example, if you wanted the A button on the Xbox to trigger the button on 2600, write A=BUTTON
*   - Use NULL keyword if you don't want the button to map to anything. B=NULL means pressing B on Xbox has no effect
*   - You can assign an output button to multiple input buttons. For example, X=BUTTON and CIRCLE=BUTTON. 
*   - When creating a new config file, keep the separator marker below.
