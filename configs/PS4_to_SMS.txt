* 1, 2, D_DOWN, D_UP, D_LEFT, D_RIGHT
*
* Special note:
* OPTIONS is mapped to D_UP for modded SMS consoles to pause when UP/DOWN are held at the same time.
* This allows you to press OPTIONS and Down on the D-PAD to pause the game.
* SHARE is mapped to D_LEFT for modded SMS consoles to pause when LEFT/RIGHT are held at the same time.
* This allows you to press SHARE and Right on the D-PAD to pause the game. 
*
* Tips:
*   - Format is PS4=SMS. For example, if you wanted the X button on the PS4 to trigger button 1 on the SMS, write X=1.
*   - Use NULL keyword if you don't want the button to map to anything. CIRCLE=NULL means pressing Circle on PS4 has no effect.
*   - You can assign an output button to multiple input buttons. For example, X=1 and CIRCLE=1. 
*   - When creating a new config file, keep the separator marker below.
