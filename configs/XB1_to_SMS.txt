* Available Xbox Options (Left of =):
* A, B, X, Y, START, SELECT, HOME, LS_PRESS, RS_PRESS, LB, RB, LT, RT, TRIGGER_DEADZONE, D_LEFT, D_RIGHT, D_DOWN, D_UP, LS_LEFT, LS_RIGHT, LS_DOWN, LS_UP, RS_LEFT, RS_RIGHT, RS_DOWN, RS_UP, STICK_DEADZONE
* Available 2600 Options (Right of =):
* 1, 2, D_DOWN, D_UP, D_LEFT, D_RIGHT, PAUSE (pause is for modded consoles, it triggers all directions at once)
* Tips:
*   1. Format is XBOX=SMS. For example, if you wanted the A button on the Xbox to trigger the button on 2600, write A=BUTTON
*   2. Use NULL keyword if you don't want the button to map to anything. B=NULL means pressing B on Xbox has no effect
*   3. Aside from buttons, there are two numerical options, TRIGGER_DEADZONE and STICK_DEADZONE. These refer to how 'far' you have to press the analog
*      inputs to trigger the button on the 2600. Ranges for these options are:
*          TRIGGER_DEADZONE range: 0-65535
*          STICK_DEADZONE range: 0-65535
