* Special note:
* START is mapped to D_UP for modded SMS consoles to pause when UP/DOWN are held at the same time.
* This allows you to press OPTIONS and Down on the D-PAD to pause the game.
* SELECT is mapped to D_LEFT for modded SMS consoles to pause when LEFT/RIGHT are held at the same time.
* This allows you to press SHARE and Right on the D-PAD to pause the game.

* Tips:
*   - Format is XBOX=SMS. For example, if you wanted the A button on the Xbox controller to trigger button 1 on the SMS, write A=1.
*   - Use NULL keyword if you don't want the button to map to anything. B=NULL means pressing B on the Xbox controller has no effect.
*   - You can assign an output button to multiple input buttons. For example, A=1 and B=1.
*   - When creating a new config file, keep the separator marker below.
