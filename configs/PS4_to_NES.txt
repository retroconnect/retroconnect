* Available Ps4 Options (Left of =):
* X, CIRCLE, TRIANGLE, SQUARE, SHARE, OPTIONS, HOME, LS_PRESS, RS_PRESS, L1, R1, L2, R2, TRIGGER_DEADZONE, D_LEFT, D_RIGHT, D_DOWN, D_UP, LS_LEFT, LS_RIGHT, LS_DOWN, LS_UP, RS_LEFT, RS_RIGHT, RS_DOWN, RS_UP, STICK_DEADZONE
* Available NES Options (Right of =):
* A, B, START, SELECT, D_DOWN, D_UP, D_LEFT, D_RIGHT
* Tips:
*   1. Format is PS4=SNES For example, if you wanted the X button on the PS4 to trigger the A button on NES, write X=A
*   2. Use NULL keyword if you don't want the button to map to anything. CIRCLE=NULL means pressing circle on PS4 has no effect
*   3. Aside from buttons, there are two numerical options, TRIGGER_DEADZONE and STICK_DEADZONE. These refer to how 'far' you have to press the analog
*      inputs to trigger the button on the NES. Ranges for these options are:
*          TRIGGER_DEADZONE range: 0-255
*          STICK_DEADZONE range: 0-255
