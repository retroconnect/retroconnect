* Available Xbox Options (Left of =):

* Available NES Options (Right of =):
* A, B, START, SELECT, D_DOWN, D_UP, D_LEFT, D_RIGHT
* Tips:
*   1. Format is XBOX=NES  For example, if you wanted the A button on the xbox to trigger the B button on NES, write A=B
*   2. Use NULL keyword if you don't want the button to map to anything. B=NULL means pressing B on xbox has no effect
*   3. Aside from buttons, there are two numerical options, TRIGGER_DEADZONE and STICK_DEADZONE. These refer to how 'far' you have to press the analog
*      inputs to trigger the button on the SNES. Ranges for these options are:
*          TRIGGER_DEADZONE range: 0-65535
*          STICK_DEADZONE range: 0-65535
