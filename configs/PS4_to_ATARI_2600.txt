* Tips:
*   - Format is PS4=2600. For example, if you wanted the X button on the PS4 controller to trigger the button on the Atari 2600, write X=BUTTON.
*   - Use NULL keyword if you don't want the button to map to anything. CIRCLE=NULL means pressing Circle on the PS4 controller has no effect.
*   - You can assign an output button to multiple input buttons. For example, X=BUTTON and CIRCLE=BUTTON. 
*   - When creating a new config file, keep the separator marker below.
