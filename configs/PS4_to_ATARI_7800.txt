* Tips:
*   - Format is PS4=7800 For example, if you wanted the X button on the PS4 to trigger BUTTON_LEFT, write X=BUTTON_LEFT.
*   - Use NULL keyword if you don't want the button to map to anything. CIRCLE=NULL means pressing circle on PS4 has no effect.
*   - You can assign an output button to multiple input buttons. For example, X=BUTTON_LEFT and CIRCLE=BUTTON_LEFT. 
*   - When creating a new config file, keep the separator marker below.
