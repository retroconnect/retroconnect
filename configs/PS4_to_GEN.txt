* Tips:
*   - Format is PS4=GEN. For example, if you wanted the X button on the PS4 controller to trigger the Start button on the Genesis, write X=START.
*   - Use NULL keyword if you don't want the button to map to anything. CIRCLE=NULL means pressing Circle on the PS4 controller has no effect.
*   - You can assign an output button to multiple input buttons. For example, X=START and CIRCLE=START. 
*   - When creating a new config file, keep the separator marker below.
