* Tips:
*   1. Format is XBOX=GEN. For example, if you wanted the A button on the Xbox to trigger the X button on GEN, write A=X
*   2. Use NULL keyword if you don't want the button to map to anything. B=NULL means pressing B on Xbox has no effect
*   3. Aside from buttons, there are two numerical options, TRIGGER_DEADZONE and STICK_DEADZONE. These refer to how 'far' you have to press the analog
*      inputs to trigger the button on the GEN. Ranges for these options are:
*          TRIGGER_DEADZONE range: 0-65535
*          STICK_DEADZONE range: 0-65535
